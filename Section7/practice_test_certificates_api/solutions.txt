A new member akshay joined our team. He requires access to our cluster. The Certificate Signing Request is at the /root location.
   cat /root/akshay.csr

Create a CertificateSigningRequest object with the name akshay with the contents of the akshay.csr file
   cat /root/akshay.csr | base64
   see file in directory
   kubectl create -f ashkay-csr.yaml

What is the Condition of the newly created Certificate Signing Request object?
   kubectl get csr --> Pending

Approve the CSR Request
   kubectl certificate approve akshay

How many CSR requests are available on the cluster?
   kubectl get csr --> 3

Who requested the csr-* request?
   kubectl get csr --> master node

During a routine check you realized that there is a new CSR request in place. What is the name of this request?
   kubectl get csr --> agent-smith

Hmmm.. You are not aware of a request coming in. What groups is this CSR requesting access to?
Check the details about the request. Preferebly in YAML.
   kubectl get csr agent-smith -o yaml --> masters, authenticated

That doesn't look very right. Reject that request.
   kubectl certificate deny agent-smith

Let's get rid of it. Delete the new CSR object
   kubectl delete csr agent-smith
