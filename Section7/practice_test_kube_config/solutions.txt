A new kubeconfig file named 'my-kube-config' is created. It is placed in the /root directory. How many clusters are defined in the kubectl file?
   cat /root/my-kube-config --> 4

How many contexts are configured in the 'my-kube-config' file?

What is the name of the client-certificate file configured for the 'aws-user'?
   cat /root/my-kube-config --> aws-user.crt

What is the current context set to in the 'my-kube-config' file?
   cat /root/my-kube-config --> test-user@development

I would like to use the dev-user to access test-cluster-1. Set the current context to the right one so I can do that.
Once the right context is identified, use the 'kubectl config use-context' command.
   kubectl config --kubeconfig=/root/my-kube-config use-context research

We don't want to have to specify the kubeconfig file option on each command. Make the my-kube-config file the default kubeconfig.
   cat /root/my-kube-config > /root/.kube/config

With the current-context set to research, we are trying to access the cluster. However something seems to be wrong. Identify and fix the issue.
Try running the kubectl get pods command and look for the error. All users certificates are stored at /etc/kubernetes/pki/users
   unable to read client-cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/developer-user.crt for dev-user due to open /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/developer-user.crt: no such file or directory
   nano /root/.kube/config --> change */development-user.crt to */dev-user.crt
