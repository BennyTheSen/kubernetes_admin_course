Kubectl suddenly stops responding to your commands. Check it out! Someone recently modified the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml file
You are asked to investigate and fix the issue. Once you fix the issue wait for sometime for kubectl to respond. Check the logs of the ETCD container.
   vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml --> change --cert-file to /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt

The kube-api server stopped again! Check it out. Inspect the kube-api server logs and identify the root cause and fix the issue.
Run docker ps -a command to identify the kube-api server container. Run docker logs container-id command to view the logs.
   docker ps -a --> find container id
   docker logs f6ac38060f5d --> Unable to create storage backend ...
   nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml --> change etcd-ca-file to /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
