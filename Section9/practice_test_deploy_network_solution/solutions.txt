In this practice test we will install weave-net POD networking solution to the cluster. Let us first inspect the setup.
What is the state of the pod deployed on the cluster?
   kubectl get pods -o wide --> NotRunning

Inspect why the POD is not running
   kubectl describe pod app-5c969b649-shxkr  --> network failed to setup.

Deploy weave-net networking solution to the cluster
   kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
