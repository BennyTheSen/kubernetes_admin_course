We just deployed a web server - webapp - that accesses a database mysql - server. However the web server is failing to connect to the database server. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.
   kubectl edit pod -n payroll web --> add mysql.payroll to db_host
   kubectl delete pod -n payroll web
   kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-nm5n4.yaml

   kubectl exec -it hr nslookup mysql.payroll > /root/nslookup.out
