The cluster is broken again. We tried deploying an application but it's not working. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.
Start looking at the deployments.
   kubectl get deployments -> not running
   kubectl describe deployments app --> unavailable
   kubectl get nodes --> seems fine
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system --> sheduler is down
   kubectl describe pods -n kube-system kube-scheduler-master --> executable file not found in $PATH": unknown
   nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml --> change command to kube-scheduler

Scale the deployment app to 2 pods.
   kubectl edit deployments app --> set replicas to 2

Even though the depoyment was scaled to 2, the number of PODs does not seem to increase. Investigate and fix the issue.
Inspect the component responsible for managing deployments and replicasets.
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system --> controller manager down
   kubectl describe pods -n kube-system kube-controller-manager-master
   nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml delete the -XXXX

Something is wrong with scaling again. We just tried scaling the deployment to 3 replicas. But it's not happening.
Investigate and fix the issue
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system --> controller manager down
   kubectl describe pods -n kube-system kube-controller-manager-master --> Error: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-master_kube-system_21d4e15128213a60fdb50943026256fc_0" is already in use by container "3a69700442dd1b4f828cd02eaa55b31f0fc8c1788ba3888b0173771bc9a76859". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
   nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml --> change WRONG-PKI-DIRECTORY to pki
