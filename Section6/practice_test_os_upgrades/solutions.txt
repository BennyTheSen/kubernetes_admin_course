Let us explore the environment first. How many nodes do you see in the cluster?
   kubectl get nodes --> 4

How many applications do you see hosted on the cluster?
   kubectl get deployments --> 2

On which nodes are the applications hosted on?
   kubectl get pods -o wide --> node01, node02, node03

We need to take node01 out for maintenance. Empty the node of all applications and mark it unschedulable.
   kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets

What nodes are the apps on now?
   kubectl get pods -o wide --> node02, node03

The maintenance tasks have been completed. Configure the node to be schedulable again.
   kubectl uncordon node01

How many pods are scheduled on node01 now?
   kubectl get pods -o wide --> 0

Why are there no pods on node01?
   only new pods will be scheduled there#

Why are there no pods placed on the master node?
   because of taint

It is now time to take down node02 for maintenance. Before you remove all workload from node02 answer the following question.
Can you drain node02 using the same command as node01? Try it.
   --> No because node not part of replicaset

What is the name of the POD not part of a replicaset hosted on node02?
   --> hr-app

What would happen to hr-app if node02 is drained forcefully?
   will be lost forever

Drain node02 and mark it unschedulable
   kubectl drain node02 --ignore-daemonsets --force

Node03 has our critical applications. We do not want to schedule any more apps on node03. Mark node03 as unschedulable but do not remove any apps currently running on it .
   kubectl cordon node03
